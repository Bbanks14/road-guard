# Architecture

The **ROAD GUARD** system consists of:

- **Hardware**: Onboard sensors (infrared cameras), GPS modules, and an embedded processing unit (Raspberry Pi).

- **Software**: Machine Learning models for threat detection, a backend for data processing, and a frontend for driver interaction.

- **Communication**: Real-time alerts via a dashboard or mobile app, with optional cloud integration for data sharing.
- **Machine Learning**: Trained models to detect patterns associated with ambushes (unusual road blockages, suspicious vehicle movements, etc.)
