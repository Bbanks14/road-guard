# ROAD GUARD: A Smart Ambush Detection System

**ROAD GUARD** is an innovative smart ambush detection system designed by engineering students in the University of Ilorin, Nigeria to enhance the safety of automobile users in Nigeria by preemptively detecting potential ambush threats on Nigerian roads. The system leverages advanced sensors, machine **learning algorithms, and real-time data processing. **ROAD GUARD\*\* as a system aims to provide early warning to drivers, helping to mitigate risks associated with road ambushes and improve overall road safety.

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources required for building and deploying the **ROAD GUARD** system.
